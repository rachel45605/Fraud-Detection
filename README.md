# Revolutionising DAI’s Vehicle Insurance Fraud Detection with Machine Learning 

Incorporating Machine Learning techniques to accurately detect insurance fraud and therefore prevent unnecessary costs and revenue loss and remain competitive. Overall, our goal is to deliver valuable inputs with high accuracy and quality as well as help increase DAI’s competitiveness.

Machine Learning has the capability to:
1. Make full use of limited data (overcoming the PDPA issue)
2. Predict future occurrences with historical data
3. Continuously improve over time with more data
 
Therefore, the use of machine learning techniques in DAI will enable us to make sense of historical fraud occurrences and to develop a system that allows them to identify fraud as an additional layer of authentication. 

A description of the file names and purpose is provided here for ease of reference:

CSV Files
1. fraud_oracle.csv: This dataset was retrieved from Kaggle, a credible and trusted platform, where datasets are reliable and mostly complete. In our case, the data uploaded by the Kaggle user extracted the data from Oracle’s database.
2. fraud_oracle.csv: This is the output from DataCleaning.R

R Scripts
1. DataCleaning.R: R script used to clean the Kaggle datasets into clean.csv
2. LogisticReg_ModelDevelopment.R: R script used to generate model and results for Logistic Regression
3. Nerual.R: R script used to generate model and results for Neural Network
