# Revolutionising DAI’s Vehicle Insurance Fraud Detection with Machine Learning 

Incorporating Machine Learning techniques to accurately detect insurance fraud and therefore prevent unnecessary costs and revenue loss and remain competitive. 

Machine Learning has the capability to:
Make full use of limited data (overcoming the PDPA issue)
Predict future occurrences with historical data
Continuously improve over time with more data
 
Therefore, the use of machine learning techniques in DAI will enable us to make sense of historical fraud occurrences and to develop a system that allows them to identify fraud as an additional layer of authentication. 

Overall, our goal is to deliver valuable inputs with high accuracy and quality as well as help increase DAI’s competitiveness.
